# nodejs-db

## Purpose and target

Target is to make a very simple DB like server to return test data for different project, like a mock server. The data should be easy to read and write. Thus, I think using a json to store, read and write data will be good for this purpose.

Thus, this is a simple expressJS in typescript server.

## Future plan

Is currently a very simple json document datastore. Planning to include different implementation of DB (like mysql or others), to serve as abstractions.

## Archived

In hindsight, there is SQLite for the job.
