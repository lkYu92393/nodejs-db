# nodejs-db

A simple expressJS in typescript server, to serve data for react query auth test (link: https://github.com/lkYu92393/react-query-auth-test).

Is currently a very simple json document datastore. Planning to include different implementation of DB (like mysql or others), to serve as abstractions.
